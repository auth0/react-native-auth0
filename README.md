## Important Notices

Version **2.9.0** introduced a **breaking change** to the Android configuration. Previously it was required to add an intent filter in the definition of the Activity that receives the authentication result, and to use the `singleTask` **launchMode** in that activity. Now both the intent filter and the launch mode **must be removed** and instead you need to add a couple of manifest placeholders. Check out the [Android](#android) section for more details.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This SDK targets apps that are using React Native SDK version `0.60.5` and up. If you're using an older React Native version, see the compatibility matrix below.

### Compatibility Matrix

This SDK attempts to follow [semver](https://semver.org/) in a best-effort basis, but React Native is still making releases that eventually include breaking changes on it making this approach difficult for any React Native library module. Use the table below to find the version that best suites your application.

| React Native SDK | Auth0 SDK |
| :--------------: | :-------: |
|     v0.65.0      |  v2.11.0  |
|     v0.62.2      |  v2.5.0   |
|     v0.60.5      |  v2.0.0   |
| v0.59.0 or lower |  v1.6.0   |

The contents of previous release can be found on the [branch v1](https://github.com/auth0/react-native-auth0/tree/v1).

### Installation

First install the native library module:

### With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

`$ npm install react-native-auth0 --save`

### With [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

`$ yarn add react-native-auth0`

Then, you need to run the following command to install the ios app pods with Cocoapods. That will auto-link the iOS library:

`$ cd ios && pod install`

### Configure the SDK

You need make your Android, iOS or Expo applications aware that an authentication result will be received from the browser. This SDK makes use of the Android's Package Name and its analogous iOS's Product Bundle Identifier to generate the redirect URL. Each platform has its own set of instructions.

#### Android

> Before version 2.9.0, this SDK required you to add an intent filter to the Activity on which you're going to receive the authentication result, and to use the `singleTask` **launchMode** in that activity. To migrate your app to version 2.9.0+, **remove both** and continue with the instructions below.
> You can also check out a sample migration diff [here](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-native-sample/commit/69f79c83ceed40f44b239bbd16e79ecaa70ef70a).

Open your app's `build.gradle` file (typically at `android/app/build.gradle`) and add the following manifest placeholders:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        // Add the next line
        manifestPlaceholders = [auth0Domain: "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN", auth0Scheme: "${applicationId}"]
    }
    ...
}
```

The `auth0Domain` value must be replaced with your Auth0 domain value. So if you have `samples.auth0.com` as your Auth0 domain you would have a configuration like the following:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        manifestPlaceholders = [auth0Domain: "samples.auth0.com", auth0Scheme: "${applicationId}"]
    }
    ...
}
```

The `applicationId` value will be auto-replaced at runtime with the package name or ID of your application (e.g. `com.example.app`). You can change this value from the `build.gradle` file. You can also check it at the top of your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

> Note that if your Android application is using [product flavors](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors), you might need to specify different manifest placeholders for each flavor.

If you use a value other than `applicationId` in `auth0Scheme` you will also need to pass it as the `customScheme` option parameter of the `authorize` and `clearSession` methods.

Take note of this value as you'll be requiring it to define the callback URLs below.

> For more info please read the [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking.html).

##### Skipping the Web Authentication setup

If you don't plan to use Web Authentication, you will notice that the compiler will still prompt you to provide the `manifestPlaceholders` values, since the `RedirectActivity` included in this library will require them, and the Gradle tasks won't be able to run without them.

Re-declare the activity manually with `tools:node="remove"` in your app's Android Manifest in order to make the manifest merger remove it from the final manifest file. Additionally, one more unused activity can be removed from the final APK by using the same process. A complete snippet to achieve this is:

```xml
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.react.AuthenticationActivity"
    tools:node="remove"/>
<!-- Optional: Remove RedirectActivity -->
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.react.RedirectActivity"
    tools:node="remove"/>
```

#### iOS

Inside the `ios` folder find the file `AppDelegate.[swift|m]` add the following to it:

```objc
#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url
            options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey, id> *)options
{
  return [RCTLinkingManager application:app openURL:url options:options];
}
```

Inside the `ios` folder open the `Info.plist` and locate the value for `CFBundleIdentifier`, e.g.

```xml
<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
```

and then below it register a URL type entry using the value of `CFBundleIdentifier` as the value for `CFBundleURLSchemes`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>None</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>auth0</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

If your application is generated using the React Native CLI, the default value of `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)` matches `org.reactjs.native.example.$(PRODUCT_NAME:rfc1034identifier)`. Take note of this value as you'll be requiring it to define the callback URLs below. If desired, you can change its value using XCode in the following way:

- Open the `ios/TestApp.xcodeproj` file replacing 'TestApp' with the name of your app or run `xed ios` from a Terminal.
- Open your project's or desired target's **Build Settings** tab and on the search bar at the right type "Product Bundle Identifier".
- Replace the **Product Bundle Identifier** value with your desired application's bundle identifier name (e.g. `com.example.app`).
- If you've changed the project wide settings, make sure the same were applied to each of the targets your app has.

If you use a value other than `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)` in the `CFBundleURLSchemes` field of the `Info.plist` you will also need to pass it as the `customScheme` option parameter of the `authorize` and `clearSession` methods.

> For more info please read the [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking.html).

#### Expo

> :warning: This SDK is not compatible with "Expo Go" app because of custom native code. It is compatible with Custom Dev Client and EAS builds

To use the SDK with Expo, configure the app at build time by providing the `domain` and (optionally) the `customScheme` values through the [Config Plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/config-plugins/). To do this, add the following snippet to _app.json_ or _app.config.js_:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-auth0",
        {
          "domain": "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN",
          "customScheme": "YOUR_CUSTOM_SCHEME",
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

| API          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| domain       | Mandatory: Provide the Auth0 domain that can be found at the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications)                                                                                                                                          |
| customScheme | Optional: Custom scheme to build the callback URL with. If not provided, uses Application ID for Android and Bundle Identifier for iOS. The value provided here should be passed to the `customScheme` option parameter of the `authorize` and `clearSession` methods |

Now you can run the application using `expo run:android` or `expo run:ios`.

### Callback URL(s)

Callback URLs are the URLs that Auth0 invokes after the authentication process. Auth0 routes your application back to this URL and appends additional parameters to it, including a token. Since callback URLs can be manipulated, you will need to add this URL to your Application's **Allowed Callback URLs** for security. This will enable Auth0 to recognize these URLs as valid. If omitted, authentication will not be successful.

On the Android platform this URL is case-sensitive. Because of that, this SDK will auto convert the Bundle Identifier (iOS) and Application ID (Android) values to lowercase in order to build the Callback URL with them. If any of these values contains uppercase characters a warning message will be printed in the console. Make sure to check that the right Callback URL is whitelisted in the Auth0 dashboard or the browser will not route succesfully back to your application.

Go to the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications), select your application and make sure that **Allowed Callback URLs** contains the URLs defined below.

If in addition you plan to use the log out method, you must also add these URLs to the **Allowed Logout URLs**.

#### Android

```text
{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME_OR_CUSTOM_SCHEME}://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/android/{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}/callback
```

> Make sure to replace {YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME_OR_CUSTOM_SCHEME} and {YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN} with the actual values for your application.

#### iOS

```text
{YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_OR_CUSTOM_SCHEME}://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/ios/{YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}/callback
```

> Make sure to replace {YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_OR_CUSTOM_SCHEME} and {YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN} with the actual values for your application.

## Next Steps

> This SDK is OIDC compliant. To ensure OIDC compliant responses from the Auth0 servers enable the **OIDC Conformant** switch in your Auth0 dashboard under `Application / Settings / Advanced OAuth`. For more information please check [this documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/intro#how-to-use-the-new-flows).

### Web Authentication

The SDK exports a React hook as the primary interface for performing [web authentication](#web-authentication) through the browser using Auth0 [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login).

Use the methods from the `useAuth0` hook to implement login, logout, and to retrieve details about the authenticated user.

See the [API Documentation](https://auth0.github.io/react-native-auth0/global.html#useAuth0) for full details on the `useAuth0` hook.

First, import the `Auth0Provider` component and wrap it around your application. Provide the `domain` and `clientId` values as given to you when setting up your Auth0 app in the dashboard:

```js
import {Auth0Provider} from 'react-native-auth0';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Auth0Provider domain="YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN" clientId="YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID">
      {/* YOUR APP */}
    </Auth0Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

<details>
  <summary>Using the `Auth0` class</summary>

If you're not using React Hooks, you can simply instantiate the `Auth0` class:

```js
import Auth0 from 'react-native-auth0';

const auth0 = new Auth0({
  domain: 'YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN',
  clientId: 'YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID',
});
```

</details>

Then import the hook into a component where you want to get access to the properties and methods for integrating with Auth0:

```js
import {useAuth0} from 'react-native-auth0';
```

#### Login

Use the `authorize` method to redirect the user to the Auth0 [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) page for authentication. 

- The `isLoading` property is set to true once the authentication state of the user is known to the SDK.
- The `user` property is populated with details about the authenticated user. If `user` is `null`, no user is currently authenticated. 
- The `error` property is populated if any error occurs.

```js
const Component = () => {
  const {authorize, user, isLoading, error} = useAuth0();

  const login = async () => {
    await authorize();
  };

  if(isLoading) {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>SDK is Loading</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }

  return (
    <View>
      {!user && <Button onPress={login} title="Log in" />}
      {user && <Text>Logged in as {user.name}</Text>}
      {error && <Text>{error.message}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};
```

<details>
  <summary>Using the `Auth0` class</summary>
  
  ```js
  auth0.webAuth
    .authorize({scope: 'openid email profile'})
    .then(credentials => console.log(credentials))
    .catch(error => console.log(error));
  ```
</details>

> Web Authentication flows require a Browser application installed on the device. When no Browser is available, an error of type `a0.browser_not_available` will be raised via the provided callback.

##### SSO Alert Box (iOS)

![ios-sso-alert](assets/ios-sso-alert.png)

Check the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more information about the alert box that pops up **by default** when using Web Auth on iOS.

> See also [this blog post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/01/13/mobile-sso) for a detailed overview of Single Sign-On (SSO) on iOS.

#### Logout

Log the user out by using the `clearSession` method from the `useAuth0` hook.

```js
const Component = () => {
  const {clearSession, user} = useAuth0();

  const logout = async () => {
    await clearSession();
  };

  return <View>{user && <Button onPress={logout} title="Log out" />}</View>;
};
```

<details>
  <summary>Using the `Auth0` class</summary>

```js
auth0.webAuth.clearSession().catch(error => console.log(error));
```

</details>

### Credentials Manager

- [Check for stored credentials](#check-for-stored-credentials)
- [Retrieve stored credentials](#retrieve-stored-credentials)
- [Local authentication](#local-authentication)
- [Credentials Manager errors](#credentials-manager-errors)

The Credentials Manager allows you to securely store and retrieve the user's credentials. The credentials will be stored encrypted in Shared Preferences on Android, and in the Keychain on iOS.

The `Auth0` class exposes the `credentialsManager` property for you to interact with using the API below.

> 💡 If you're using Web Auth (`authorize`) through Hooks, you do not need to manually store the credentials after login and delete them after logout; the SDK does this automatically.

#### Check for stored credentials

When the users open your app, check for valid credentials. If they exist, you can retrieve them and redirect the users to the app's main flow without any additional login steps.

```js
const isLoggedIn = await auth0.credentialsManager.hasValidCredentials();

if (isLoggedIn) {
  // Retrieve credentials and redirect to the main flow
} else {
  // Redirect to the login page
}
```

#### Retrieve stored credentials

The credentials will be automatically renewed using the [refresh token](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens), if the access token has expired. **This method is thread safe**.

```js
const credentials = await auth0.credentialsManager.getCredentials();
```

> 💡 You do not need to call credentialsManager.saveCredentials() afterward. The Credentials Manager automatically persists the renewed credentials.

#### Local authentication

You can enable an additional level of user authentication before retrieving credentials using the local authentication supported by the device, for example PIN or fingerprint on Android, and Face ID or Touch ID on iOS.

```js
await auth0.credentialsManager.requireLocalAuthentication();
```

Check the [API documentation](https://auth0.github.io/react-native-auth0/CredentialsManager#requireLocalAuthentication) to learn more about the available LocalAuthentication properties.

> :warning: You need a real device to test Local Authentication for iOS. Local Authentication is not available in simulators.

#### Credentials Manager errors

The Credentials Manager will only throw `CredentialsManagerError` exceptions. You can find more information in the details property of the exception.

```js
try {
  const credentials = await auth0.credentialsManager.getCredentials();
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```
